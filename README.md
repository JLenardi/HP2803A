# HP2803A

A two-channel instrument that uses quartz crystal resonators with a linear frequency-temperature characteristic to measure temperature to a maximum resolution of 0.0001°C at 10 second intervals.

## Architecture

The firmware is written in C and targets an AVR ATmega644A microcontroller with an A64-based simulator for development and testing.
